eos-parental-controls
=====================

eos-parental-controls implements support for restricting the abilities of
non-administrator accounts on an Endless OS system. Typically, when this is
used, a non-administrator account will be for a child using the system; and the
administrator accounts will be for the parents.

It provides an accounts service vendor extension for storing an app filter to
restrict the child’s access to certain applications; and a simple library for
accessing and applying the app filter.

All the library APIs are currently unstable and are likely to change wildly.
