      AppFilter:

      A filter for which applications and binaries the user can run. This is
      intended to be set by administrators and read by users, rather than being
      editable by the user themselves.

      The string list contains flatpak application IDs (containing at least one
      dot and no leading slash) and absolute binary paths (containing a leading
      slash). The boolean value indicates whether this is an allowlist (true)
      or blocklist (false).

    <!--
      OarsFilter:

      A filter for which applications the user can see in app lists and install.
      This is intended to be set by administrators and read by users, rather
      than being editable by the user themselves.

      It’s a two-tuple of the rating type, and a dictionary of rating sections
      and values. The type gives the rating scheme in use — currently only
      `oars-1.0` and `oars-1.1` are supported.

      Each dictionary entry is a mapping from an OARS section to the
      most severe value for it which the user is allowed to see (inclusive). Any
      app with a more severe value for any section must not be listed or
      installable by the user.

      An empty dictionary means that no OARS filtering is to be performed for
      the user.

      This setting is essentially equivalent to the `content_rating` dictionary
      in AppStream data:
